[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/iron-meteor/iron-cli](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/iron-meteor/iron-cli?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A command line scaffolding tool for Meteor applications. It automatically
creates project structure, files and boilerplate code.

## Installation
Install the iron command line tool globally so you can use it from any project directory.

```sh
$ npm install -g iron-meteor
```

**This replaces the `em` command line tool.**

You can remove the meteor-em tool like this:

```sh
$ npm uninstall -g meteor-em
```

You can upgrade an existing project either by hande or by using the `migrate`
command like this:

**./my-app**
```sh
$ iron migrate
```

## Usage
Use the `help` command to get a list of the top level commands.

```
$ iron help
```

Use the `g` command to see a list of generators.

```
$ iron g
```

**Run Iron in verbose mode (extended logging)**

```
$ IRON_DEBUG=true iron
```

## Directory Structure
The application will have the following directory structure:

```sh
my-app/
 .iron/
   config.json
 bin/
 build/
 config/
   development/
     env.sh
     settings.json
 app/
   client/
     collections/
     lib/
     stylesheets/
     templates/
     head.html
   lib/
     collections/
     controllers/
     methods.js
     routes.js
   packages/
   private/
   public/
   server/
     collections/
     lib/
     methods.js
     publish.js
     bootstrap.js
```

## Generators
```sh
$ iron g:scaffold todos
$ iron g:template todos/todo_item
$ iron g:collection todos
$ iron g:route webhooks/stripe --where "server"
$ iron g:controller todos/show_todo
$ iron g:route todos/show_todo --action "show"
$ iron g:publish todos
$ iron g:stylesheet main
$ iron g:package package:name
```

## Commands

### Create an Application
```sh
$ iron create my-app
```

The following parameters can be specified:
```
--css=css|scss|less
--js=js|coffee|es6
--html=html|jade
--skip-template-css=true|false
--skip-template-js=true|false
--skip-template-html=true|false
--skip-iron-router
--skip-route-controller
--skip-route-template
--skip-generator-comments
```

**NOTE**

*Implementing complete customization and configuration is high on the development priority list. See the [Github issue](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-cli/issues/53) if you'd like to contribute.*

### Run Your Application
```sh
$ iron run
```

This will automatically load your config/development/env.sh and config/development/settings.json files.

### Run the Application with a Different Environment
```sh
$ iron run --env=staging
```

This will use the config files in `config/staging` instead.

### Debug Your Application on the Server Side
```sh
$ iron debug
```

### Build Your Application
```sh
$ iron build
```

### Connect to MongoDB Database
```sh
$ cd app/
$ meteor mongo
```

**NOTE**

*Ideally running `iron mongo` in the project directory should work but it doesn't for some reason and is being tracked in issue #136*

## Deployment

### Deploy Your Application with Meteor Up
[Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) is a command line tool to deploy any Meteor app to your own server.

#### Configure Meteor Up
The following configuration options are supported in `config.json`:

```
"mup": {
  "version": "mup" or "mupx",
  "environment": "/path/to/environment"
}
```

#### Initialize Meteor Up
Use `iron mup` to run Meteor Up commands. To create a `mup.json` file for an environment run:

```sh
$ iron mup <environment> --init
```

**IMPORTANT**

Your `mup.json` file must contain `"enableUploadProgressBar": false` to work with Iron.

#### Create Meteor Up Server
After [configuring](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up/#example-file) `mup.json`, the server can be bootstrapped with a single command:

```sh
$ iron mup <environment> --setup
```

#### Deploy to Meteor Up Environment
```sh
$ iron mup development //deploy to development environment
$ iron mup dev // shortcut for development
$ iron mup production
$ iron mup prod
$ iron mup <custom-from-config>
```

### Deploy Your Application on Heroku
Iron projects require buildpacks to look for the app in /app/ in addition to the root for deployments to work. Currently there is a patched version of the Horse buildpack available that is compatible with Iron based projects. Use this fork until the patches has been added to the main Horse repo.

```sh
$ heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/lirbank/meteor-buildpack-horse.git
```

This will build your application and put the resulting bundle into the project's
build folder.

## Meteor Commands
Meteor commands will automatically be proxied to the meteor command line tool.
